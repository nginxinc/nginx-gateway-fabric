# gRPC Routing Example

In this example, we deploy NGINX Gateway Fabric, a simple gRPC web application, and then configure NGINX Gateway Fabric
to route traffic to that application using GRPCRoute resources.

## Running the Example

## 1. Deploy NGINX Gateway Fabric

1. Follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-gateway-fabric/installation/) to deploy NGINX Gateway Fabric.
    > **Important**: Ensure the Gateway APIs from the experimental channel are installed and that NGF is deployed with the Gateway experimental features enabled.

1. Save the public IP address of NGINX Gateway Fabric into a shell variable:

    ```text
    GW_IP=XXX.YYY.ZZZ.III
    ```

1. Save the port of NGINX Gateway Fabric:

    ```text
    GW_PORT=<port number>
    ```

## 2. Deploy the Helloworld Application

1. Create the two helloworld Deployments and Services:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f helloworld.yaml
    ```

1. Check that the Pods are running in the `default` Namespace:

    ```shell
    kubectl -n default get pods
    ```

    ```text
    NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    grpc-infra-backend-v1-766c7d6788-rg92p   1/1     Running   0          12s
    grpc-infra-backend-v2-546f7c8d48-mjkkx   1/1     Running   0          12s
    ```

   Save these pod names into variables:

    ```text
    POD_V1=<grpc-infra-backend-v1-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx>
    POD_V2=<grpc-infra-backend-v2-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx>
    ```

## 3. Configure Routing

There are 3 options to configure gRPC routing. To access the application and test the routing rules, we will use [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

### 3a. Configure exact method matching based routing

1. Create the Gateway and GRPCRoute resources:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f exact-method.yaml
    ```

2. Test the Application:

    ```shell
    grpcurl -plaintext -proto grpc.proto -authority bar.com -d '{"name": "exact"}' ${GW_IP}:${GW_PORT} helloworld.Greeter/SayHello
    ```

    ```text
    {
        "message": "Hello exact"
    }
    ```

3. Clean up the Gateway and GRPCRoute resources:

    ```shell
    kubectl delete -f exact-method.yaml
    ```

### 3b. Configure hostname based routing

1. Create the Gateway and GRPCRoute resources:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f hostname.yaml
    ```

2. Test the Application:

    ```shell
    grpcurl -plaintext -proto grpc.proto -authority bar.com -d '{"name": "bar server"}' ${GW_IP}:${GW_PORT} helloworld.Greeter/SayHello
    ```

    ```text
    {
        "message": "Hello bar server"
    }
    ```

   To make sure this came from the correct server, we can check the application server logs:

    ```shell
    kubectl logs ${POD_V1}
    ```

    ```text
    2024/04/29 09:26:54 server listening at [::]:50051
    2024/04/29 09:28:54 Received: bar server
    ```

   Now we'll send a request to `foo.bar.com`

    ```shell
    grpcurl -plaintext -proto grpc.proto -authority foo.bar.com -d '{"name": "foo bar server"}' ${GW_IP}:${GW_PORT} helloworld.Greeter/SayHello
    ```

    ```text
    {
        "message": "Hello foo bar server"
    }
    ```

   This time, we'll check the POD_V2 logs:

    ```shell
    kubectl logs ${POD_V2}
    ```

    ```text
    2024/04/29 09:26:55 server listening at [::]:50051
    2024/04/29 09:29:46 Received: foo bar server
    ```

3. Clean up the Gateway and GRPCRoute resources:

    ```shell
    kubectl delete -f hostname.yaml
    ```

### 3c. Configure headers based routing

1. Create the Gateway and GRPCRoute resources:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f headers.yaml
    ```

2. Test the Application:

    ```shell
    grpcurl -plaintext -proto grpc.proto -authority bar.com -d '{"name": "version one"}' -H 'version: one' ${GW_IP}:${GW_PORT} helloworld.Greeter/SayHello
    ```

    ```text
    {
        "message": "Hello version one"
    }
    ```

   To make sure this came from the correct server, we can check the application server logs:

    ```shell
    kubectl logs ${POD_V1}
    ```

    ```text
    <...>
    2024/04/29 09:30:27 Received: version one
    ```

   Now we'll send a request with the header `version: two`

    ```shell
    grpcurl -plaintext -proto grpc.proto -authority bar.com -d '{"name": "version two"}' -H 'version: two' ${GW_IP}:${GW_PORT} helloworld.Greeter/SayHello
    ```

    ```text
    {
        "message": "Hello version two"
    }
    ```

   This time, we'll check the POD_V2 logs:

    ```shell
    kubectl logs ${POD_V2}
    ```

    ```text
    <...>
    2024/04/29 09:32:46 Received: version two
    ```

   Finally, we'll send a request with the headers `version: two` and `color: orange`

    ```shell
    grpcurl -plaintext -proto grpc.proto -authority bar.com -d '{"name": "version two orange"}' -H 'version: two' -H 'color: orange' ${GW_IP}:${GW_PORT} helloworld.Greeter/SayHello
    ```

   ```text
   {
     "message": "Hello version two orange"
   }
   ```

   Now check the POD_V1 logs again:

   ```shell
   kubectl logs ${POD_V1}
   ```

   ```text
   <...>
   2024/04/29 09:30:27 Received: version one
   2024/04/29 09:33:26 Received: version two orange
   ```

3. Clean up the Gateway and GRPCRoute resources:

   ```shell
   kubectl delete -f headers.yaml
   ```
