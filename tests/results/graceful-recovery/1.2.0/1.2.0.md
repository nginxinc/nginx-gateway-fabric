```

## Tests

### Restart nginx-gateway container

No errors.

### Restart NGINX container

Same error as 1.1: https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/issues/1108

### Restart Node with draining

No errors.

### Restart Node without draining

Same issue as 1.1 where NGF is unable to recover: https://github.com/nginx/nginx-gateway-fabric/issues/1108

New error log in the previous NGF container:

```text
W0318 19:01:31.984977       6 reflector.go:462] pkg/mod/k8s.io/client-go@v0.29.3/tools/cache/reflector.go:229: watch of *v1.EndpointSlice ended with: an error on the server ("unable to decode an event from the watch stream: context canceled") has prevented the request from succeeding
```

This log comes from the client-go library that is reporting a context canceled event as an error. It is not actionable.

## Future Improvements

- None
