encourage you to open a [discussion](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/discussions) on GitHub.

#### Report a Bug

reporting a bug, make sure the issue has not already been reported.

#### Suggest an Enhancement

To suggest an enhancement, [open an idea][idea] on GitHub discussions. We highly recommend that you open a discussion

In some cases, the maintainers may ask you to write an Enhancement Proposal. For details on this process, see
the [Enhancement Proposal](/docs/proposals/README.md) README.
