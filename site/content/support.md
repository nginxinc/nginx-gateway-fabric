After opening a support ticket, F5 staff will request additional information to better understand the problem.

The [nginx-supportpkg-for-k8s](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-supportpkg-for-k8s) plugin collects the information needed by F5 Technical Support to assist with troubleshooting your issue.
The plugin uses [krew](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io), the plugin manager for the Kubernetes [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) command-line tool.

The plugin may collect some or all of the following global and namespace-specific information:

- Kubernetes version and information about Nodes and Custom Resources
- Kubernetes metrics
- Helm deployments
- List of Pods, Events, ConfigMaps, Services, Deployments, Daemonsets, StatefulSets, ReplicaSets, and Leases
- Pod log output
- `nginx -T` output from NGINX-related Pods

This plugin **does not** collect secrets or coredumps.
